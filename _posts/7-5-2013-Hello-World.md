 I don't really know what I'd do to make money if I couldn't build websites. I have a degree in journalism, but it turns out I'm kind of a shitty writer (with the exception of this entry, which is beautiful and elegant prose). I started building in 1998ish, when I was a student/intern in London. A swell fella named Matt Zandstra was super nice, and gave me a paid internship at Corrosive Web Design when the only way I knew how to build a web page was with FrontPage or Dreamweaver. He promptly showed me where the text editor was and I've been hand crafting my code ever since. 

The first few years were exciting and full of learning. I worked in a few different cities and countries for a few different companies, and experienced the tech boom and bust with a front row seat. When the dust had settled, I decided I'd like to work in the public sector making stuff people needed rather than wanted. I ended being the first full-time web developer hired by the Institute for Community Inclusion, at non-profit in Boston that worked for the inclusion of people with disabilities. 

The first few years where a great time for me and an exciting time for the web. Doug Bowman, then with Wired.com, created the first mainstream site to use table-less (css-only) layouts. It completely changed how websites where built and I picked apart his code to build my own UI for a CMS I built for my organization. 

For me, and maybe the web in general, they next few years were a little dull. I felt myself hitting a rut with my work and wondering why I liked building for the web in the first place. Then two things emerged. 

1. Responsive Design/Progressive Enhancement
2. Twitter and GitHub

Responsive design just seemed like the natural step forward for the web to embrace mobile technology. But I feel like Twitter was more important to me (and no, not just for Bootstrap, which endlessly abuse). Part of my rut was due to the fact that I was somewhat isolated in my job as a web developer. Twitter allowed me to see what other people are working on and into, connect with people (sometimes IRL), and attend geek social events. Suddenly it felt like early days again, and I felt eager to seek inspiration and mentorship from those in my field. It has changed how I feel about the web and my choice in career in a massively positive way.

Which brings me to why I am writing this today. I've been inspired by people in my local community and in the larger one (Chris Colier should be mentioned here) who have publicly documented their learning experience. I can see both my benefit of reading their work, as well as how they might benefit as well. And while I may not have anything good to contribute on Github, I might as well write about my own experience and discoveries I make in my own work.

So thank you all for being such a cool crowd to work with, and thanks for all the inspiration you've given me.
