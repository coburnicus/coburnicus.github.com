      <a href="/2013/07/18/I-get-it.html">Trolling Stone</a>    </h2>

      <p><em>Disclaimer: I&#39;ve lived and worked in Boston for 13 years</em></p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/07/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-rolling-stone-cover-controversy.html">few</a> <a href="http://dave.smallpict.com/2013/07/17/theTerroristRockStar">different</a> <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/07/17/boston_bomber_rolling_stone_cover_with_dzokhar_tsarnaev_is_good_journalism.html">articles</a> defending the Rolling Stone cover (and to be clear we are just talking about the cover, the article was really well written), and the gist of most is that RS is brilliantly confronting us with the fact this is an handsome, likable kid who did these terrible acts. No shit. We were confronted with this awful dichotomy months ago. Anybody who has followed the story with any interest has already been struck by and read articles showing us how well liked this kid was.</p>

<p>Intellectually I understand the RS cover, and it still pisses me off. It pisses me off because it is one thing to put a photo of a murderer on your cover. It becomes another thing to airbrush the photo, drop-shadow the iconic logo over it, and literally put his face and name alongside Jay-Z and other celebrities. Rolling Stone says they did it this way for their readership but it is precisely because of their readership (teens and young adults) that they should not have run the cover in this manner.</p>

<p>And for what reason? Nothing has changed in the national narrative, we already new this was a complicated kid. The only thing that is different now is the Rolling Stone has inserted its name and brand into this discussion, and now we are talking about them. And at what cost? More raw nerves have be tweaked and more anger and vitriol has been thrown into a scene that already has too much of both. To me it seems Rolling Stone made the decision to run this cover not for the benefit of its readership, but for the benefit of itself. I&#39;ve had 24 hours to calm down and get over my &quot;outrage&quot; yet I still think my original reaction is right: Rolling Stone, seriously, get fucked.</p>

  
    <h2>
      <a href="/2013/05/07/Hello-World.html">Fuck it, we'll build a blog</a>    </h2>

      <p>I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;d do to make money if I couldn&#39;t build websites. I have a degree in journalism, but it turns out I&#39;m kind of a shitty writer (with the exception of this entry, which is beautiful and elegant prose). I started building in 1998ish, when I was a student/intern in London. A swell fella named Matt Zandstra was super nice, and gave me a paid internship at Corrosive Web Design when the only way I knew how to build a web page was with FrontPage or Dreamweaver. He promptly showed me where the text editor was and I&#39;ve been hand crafting my code ever since. </p>

<p>The first few years were exciting and full of learning. I worked in a few different cities and countries for a few different companies, and experienced the tech boom and bust with a front row seat. When the dust had settled, I decided I&#39;d like to work in the public sector making stuff people needed rather than wanted. I ended being the first full-time web developer hired by the Institute for Community Inclusion, at non-profit in Boston that worked for the inclusion of people with disabilities. </p>

<p>The first few years where a great time for me and an exciting time for the web. Doug Bowman, then with Wired.com, created the first mainstream site to use table-less (css-only) layouts. It completely changed how websites where built and I picked apart his code for weeks to build my own UI for a CMS I built for my organization. </p>

<p>For me, and maybe the web in general, they next few years were a little dull. I felt myself hitting a rut with my work and wondering why I liked building for the web in the first place. Then two things emerged. </p>

<ol>
<li>Responsive Design/Progressive Enhancement</li>
<li>Twitter and GitHub</li>
</ol>

<p>Responsive design just seemed like the natural step forward for the web to embrace mobile technology. But I feel like Twitter was more important to me (and no, not just for Bootstrap, which I endlessly abuse). Part of my rut was due to the fact that I was somewhat isolated in my job as a web developer. Twitter allowed me to see what other people are working on and into, connect with people (sometimes IRL), and attend geek social events. Suddenly it felt like early days again, and I felt eager to seek inspiration and mentorship from those in my field. It has changed how I feel about the web and my choice in career in a massively positive way.</p>

<p>Which brings me to why I am writing this today. I&#39;ve been inspired by people in my local community and in the larger one who have publicly documented their learning experience. Bigger names like <a href="https://twitter.com/beep">Ethan Marcotte</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wilto">Mat Marquis</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chriscoyier">Chris Coyier</a>, and Boston&#39;s up and coming <a href="https://twitter.com/fredhq">Fred Leblanc</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/marcamos">Marc Amos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dperrera">Dan Perrera</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_fasterhorses">Nick Snyder</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nikibrown">Niki Brown</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/berkleebassist"> Jeff Byrnes</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmynotjim">Jimmy Wilson</a>. I can see both my benefit of reading their work, as well as how they might benefit as well. And while I may not have anything good to contribute on Github, I might as well write about my own experience and discoveries I make in my own work.</p>

<p>So thank you all for being such a cool crowd to work with, and thanks for all the inspiration you&#39;ve given me. </p>

<p>As you were.</p>
