			<h2> Get Scrummed </h2>
<p>Over the last couple of years an amazing transformation has happened in the federal, and even state-level, government with regards to technology. The much need arrival of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">United States Digital Service</a> and <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> have brought with it modern development and management methods such as AGILE. It has been amazing to watch these folks use open sources tools, and modern methodologies to create deeply needed and truly functional web tools, in the open. It has motivated me to <em>attempt</em> drag myself and my organization into the same league with them, and to make ourselves more attractive to federal work.</p>

<p>To that end, I decided to try and get myself educated on Agile, and with much less effort than I thought, I&#39;m able to say that I am a Certified Scrum Master. So if you need any scrums mastered, you know, let me know.</p>

<p>Now comes the hard part, trying to implement Agile into a 30-year-old organization, with very entrenched behaviors. Wish me luck.</p>

			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>I'm Jeff Coburn, I lead Web Services at the School for Global Inclusion and the Institute for Community Inclusion (located at the University of Massachusetts Boston). I do some developement, a little design, but if I'm honest with myself, I spend a lot of time planning things and writing emails about planning things. I occasionally write and speak on Web Accessiblity and technology. I try to live the "joie de vivre" up here in Southern Maine, with my family and friends.</p>

<p>You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/coburnicus">twitter</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/coburnicus_rex">Instagram</a>, if you are into that sort of thing.</p>
